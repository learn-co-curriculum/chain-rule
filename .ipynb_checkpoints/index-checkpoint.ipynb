    "Before getting into the chain rule, whatever that is, let's make sure we fully understand what we mean when we call a function $f(x)$.  When we label a function $f(x)$, we are indicating that the output of the function is dependent on the value of $x$.  This means that different input values of $x$ will produce a different output values for the function.  For example, in the function $f(x) = x^2 $, the output of $x^2$ is dependent on, or varies with, different values of $x$.  Similarly, in the function $f(y) = y^3$, the function $f(y)$ depends on different values of $y$.  "

The chain rule answers the question of how do take the derivative of a function $\\frac{df}{dx}f$ when a function $f$ does not directly depend on $x$, but does depend on another function, $g$ that depends on $x$?  \n",
