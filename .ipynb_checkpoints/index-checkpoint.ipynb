    "Before getting into the chain rule, let's review the following.  When we label a function as equalling $f(x)$, we are saying that the output of the function is dependent on the value of $x$.  This means that different values of $x$ will produce a different output for the function.  For example, we would say $f(x) = x^2 $, as the output of $x^2$ is dependent on different values of $x$.  Similarly, we would say that $f(y) = y^3$, as the output depends on different values of $y$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So whatever is in the parentheses just means, \"is dependent on.\"  This would be wrong: $f(y) = x$.  That doesn't seem right as the output is not a function of $y$, it is a function of $x$ meaning it's output changes with different values of $x$.  The output of a function can even be depenedent on other functions.  For example consider the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$g = x + 1 $$ and \n",
    "$$f = g + 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to indicate that $g$ depends on different values of $x$, we would describe this function as $g(x) = x + 1$.  As the value of $x$ changes the output of that function changes.  Now the function $f$ varies with different values of the function $g$.  When $g(x) = 3 + 1$, then $f = 4 + 1 = 5 $.  So the output of $f$ depends on $g$ and the output of $g$ depends on $x$.  So rewriting our two functions to express this, we would say: \n",

    "$$g(x) = x + 1 $$ and \n",
    "$$f(g(x)) = g(x) + 1$$\n",

Remember that in taking the derivative $\\frac{df}{dx}f(x)$, we are really asking what happens to the output of the function $f(x)$ when we change $x$ a little bit.  But our function $f(x)$ does not directly depend on $x$.  Well, the chain rule tells us how to solve just this.  The chain rule answers the question of how do take the derivative of a function $\\frac{df}{dx}f$ when a function $f$ does not directly depend on $x$, but does depend on another function, $g$ that depends on $x$?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule states that given a function $f$ where $f$, depends on a function $g$ which depends on $x$, $\\frac{df}{dx}f = \\frac{df}{dg}f(g)*\\frac{df}{dx}g(x)$.  Yes it's a mouthful, but it's not so bad in practice."

We identified this change in output from an infintesimally small change in input as our derivative.  \n",
